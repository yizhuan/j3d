#How to run

Due to strict security policies (and Java-plugins are not supported in browsers any more), it is not easy to run Java program directly over the web, but you can still run the Java programs easily on your local machine using Java Web Start. You need to install latest Java (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) on your machine and use "Configure Java" to add "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yizhuan" as trusted sites, then run the following on command lines:
